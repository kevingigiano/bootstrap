# bootstrap
Bootstrap my local development environment.
Setup all the things I need for a local development box (CentOS).

## Setup
1) Copy bootstrap.sh and bashrc (as .bashrc) to target system

2) Make boostrap.sh executable (chmod +x)

3) (optional) create a local file (~/.creds) for storing credentials you want to source for all sessions.

4) Run script

    $ ./bootstrap.sh
